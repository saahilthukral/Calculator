# Calculator

I created this Calculator from Scratch using everything I know about JS DOM methods, basic CSS and HTML. 

While creating this project, I learned new skills which will prove to be useful. For example, I have gained knowledge about grids in CSS, which made quite easy for me to set the buttons in the order I wanted.

I also learned a bit about pseudoclasses, which while I have not used extensively here, adds a bit of flair.

TODO: Add Keyboard support to type in numbers for the project.
